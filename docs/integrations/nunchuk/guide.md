1. Open Nunchuk and select the Profile -> Network Settings

2. Enter your preferred electrs hostname and port (found in `Services > Electrs` then the Interfaces section) into the `Mainnet server` field.

3. Save network settings then restart Nunchuk

**Note:** If you chose to user you Tor hostname and port, make sure to toggle on "Enable TOR proxy", also under network settings. You'll need to be [running Tor](https://docs.start9.com/user-manual/connecting-remotely/tor.html) on your client device for this to work.
